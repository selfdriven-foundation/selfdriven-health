## Practitioner-In-The-Loop Services (PITLS)

- *GenAI* services, e.g. ChatGPT, often require a practitioner as part of the process ("in the loop") to ensure the intelligence is applied effectively and meaningfully.
- Practitioners who excel at human connection are essential to help people engage with *GenAI*-driven solutions.

### Example

- **"Child with speech difficulties."**
    - Parent consults *GenAI*
    -  *GenAI* creates a plan
    - Parent starts the plan with the child
    - Child won't engage with the plan/process
    - Parent goes back to  *GenAI*
    -  *GenAI* identifies practitioners who can be be incorported in the health loop.

### Services In Practice

- We are building a community of health practitioners who recognise the transformative impact of *GenAI*, helping deliver better health outcomes for humans, at scale.
    - Current focus is building the team in preparation for running pilots:
    - How to organise practice in a society where *GenAI* is integrated
    - Practice framework (Why, What, How, Who, When, Where)
        - Application for diagnosis
        - How to collaborate with *GenAI*, now that it is being used by society for diagnosis

### Tech
- **"*GenAI* searches for humans"**
    -  *GenAI* seeks *PITL services* using the Model-Context-Protocol (MCP) to find based on location and expertise.
    - *selfdriven.health* supports the MCP service using the [selfdrivenOS](https://github.com/selfdriven-engagement/selfdrivenOS).

*A practitioner is someone who actively engages in a profession, discipline, or craft, applying their knowledge and skills in practice rather than just theory.*
