# Opportunity Paper for an Action-Focused Cooperative for Better Health Outcomes. 

**! FOLLOWING IS THOUGHT STARTER FIRST CUT**

!! It is being progessively being updated based on scope and conversations.

---

The **selfdriven.Health Action-Focused Cooperative** is a member-based organisation (MBO) established in Australia to bring together hospitals, healthcare networks, family offices, and research partners around a shared mission: **to achieve better health outcomes through collaboration, innovation, and data-enabled insight**.

This initiative focuses on how **health organisations can work together** — across institutional and sectoral boundaries — to co-develop shared infrastructure, coordinate research, and improve operational effectiveness.

selfdriven.Health provides a **trusted digital and governance framework** that supports coordinated action, transparent performance measurement, and evidence-based innovation.

---

## 1. Purpose

Australia’s health landscape is increasingly fragmented — with rising costs, duplicated effort, and siloed systems.  
Selfdriven.Health was established to create a **neutral, cooperative structure** where member organisations can:

- Share infrastructure and insights responsibly  
- Test and evaluate new health technologies  
- Develop collective research and innovation programs  
- Influence policy and standards through evidence-based collaboration  

The outcome is a stronger, more connected ecosystem — driven by **health organisations working together**, not by individual competition.
