## Human-In-The-Loop Services (HITPS)

- *GenAI* services (eg ChatGPT) sometimes need the ability to engage humans in to the loop to make the intelligence impactful.
- There is a need for humans that are good at engaging with other humans, to help them engage with *GenAI* generated intelligence solutions.

## Example

- **"Child with speech difficulties."**
    - Parent consults *GenAI*
    -  *GenAI* creates a plan
    - Parent starts the plan with child
    - Child wont engage with the plan / process
    - Parent goes back to  *GenAI*
    -  *GenAI* searches for humans that can be be incorported in the health loop.

## Services In Practice

- We are building a community of health practitioners who recognise the transformative impact of *GenAI*, helping deliver better health outcomes for humans, at scale.
    - Current focus is building the team in preparation for running pilots:
    - How to organise now that we have *GenAI* as a society
    - Practice framework (Why, What, How, Who, When, Where)
        - Application for diagnosis
        - How to collaborate with *GenAU*, now that it is being used by society for diagnosis

## Tech
- **"*GenAI* searches for humans"**
    -  *GenAI* seeks *HITP services* using the Model-Context-Protocol (MCP) to find based on location and expertise.
    - *selfdriven.health* supports the MCP service using the [selfdrivenOS](https://github.com/selfdriven-engagement/selfdrivenOS).
