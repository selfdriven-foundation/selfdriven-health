# Selfdriven.Health  
### Whitepaper  
**Aligning Australia’s Leading Health Organisations for Systemic Impact**

**Date:** October 2025  
**Authors:** The Selfdriven.Health Founding Team  
**Version:** 1.2 (Member-Focused Revision)

---

## Executive Summary

**Selfdriven.Health** is a **member-based organisation (MBO)** established in Australia to bring together hospitals, healthcare networks, family offices, and research partners around a shared mission: **to achieve better health outcomes through collaboration, innovation, and data-enabled insight**.

This initiative focuses on how **health organisations can work together** — across institutional and sectoral boundaries — to co-develop shared infrastructure, coordinate research, and improve operational effectiveness.

Powered by **beHub**, a licensed health technology platform, Selfdriven.Health provides a **trusted digital and governance framework** that supports coordinated action, transparent performance measurement, and evidence-based innovation.

---

## 1. Purpose

Australia’s health landscape is increasingly fragmented — with rising costs, duplicated effort, and siloed systems.  
Selfdriven.Health was established to create a **neutral, cooperative structure** where member organisations can:

- Share infrastructure and insights responsibly  
- Test and evaluate new health technologies  
- Develop collective research and innovation programs  
- Influence policy and standards through evidence-based collaboration  

The outcome is a stronger, more connected ecosystem — driven by **health organisations working together**, not by individual competition.

## 4. Operating Model

Selfdriven.Health is designed as a **platform for organisational collaboration**, not a direct service provider to patients.  
Members remain independent entities but align around shared priorities, data, and governance structures.

### 4.1 Core Functions
1. **Coordination** — Connect institutions, foundations, and innovators.  
2. **Research & Evaluation** — Co-design, test, and assess new health solutions.  
3. **Technology Integration** — Provide access to the beHub platform for data interoperability.  
4. **Knowledge Sharing** — Disseminate insights and frameworks across sectors.  
5. **Strategic Representation** — Engage with government, academia, and industry.

### 4.2 Services

- **Research**  
  - Practical projects addressing current system gaps.  
  - Forward-looking studies into future models of care.

- **Engagement**  
  - Facilitation of member roundtables and Communities of Practice.  
  - Multi-sector working groups on data, workforce, and innovation.

- **Digital Infrastructure**  
  - Operated under licence from **beHub**.  
  - Supports secure collaboration, data governance, and analytics.  
  - Members pay base + usage licence fees to sustain platform access.

---

## 5. Technology Partnership — beHub

**beHub** provides the technology layer underpinning Selfdriven.Health, enabling secure data exchange, multi-party collaboration, and applied analytics across member organisations.

### 5.1 Capabilities
- **Data Interoperability:** Connecting systems across hospitals, research, and policy.  
- **Secure Exchange:** Entity-based permissions and audit trails.  
- **Analytics & Insights:** Collective intelligence for outcome measurement.  
- **Governance Layer:** Consent, data rights, and compliance management.  

### 5.2 Implementation

- entityOS.cloud hosts the operational backend.  
- app.selfdriven.health used for governance dashboards and collaboration tools.  
- Licence model: annual base fee + usage component, paid by members.

## 6. Governance Framework

### 6.1 Structure
- **Board of Directors:** Comprised of representatives from founding members.  
- **Advisory Council:** Associates and strategic partners.  
- **Working Groups:** Focused on research, policy, data, and innovation.

### 6.2 Principles
- Shared governance; no single controlling entity.  
- Transparent decision-making.  
- Financial and operational accountability.  
- Evidence-based policy influence.

---

## 7. Establishing the Organisation in Australia

### 7.1 Legal Structure
Selfdriven.Health will be registered as a **Company Limited by Guarantee (CLG)** under the Corporations Act 2001 — suitable for multi-state membership and limited liability.  

Alternate models (incorporated association or co-operative) may be used for local pilots but will transition into the CLG framework as the national body.

### 7.2 Steps
1. Draft constitution and membership rules.  
2. Register CLG with **ASIC**; apply for ABN and business name.  
3. Establish governance policies and conflict-of-interest framework.  
4. Apply for not-for-profit status (if appropriate).  
5. Insure for public liability, management, and cyber risks.  
6. Launch initial operational phase with founding members.

---

## 8. Financial Model & Sustainability

### 8.1 Year 1 Funding
- Total: $350,000  
- Funded by 8 founding members  
- Used for setup, licensing, and operational leadership.

### 8.2 Ongoing Sustainability
Revenue sources:
- Annual membership fees (organisational tiers).  
- Platform licence and data usage fees.  
- Research grants and government partnerships.  
- Strategic project co-funding with members.  

### 8.3 Growth Path
- Year 1: Establish foundation and digital platform.  
- Year 2: Grow membership base and joint projects.  
- Year 3–5: Expand into national networks and influence health policy.
