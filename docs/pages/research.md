## Research into better human health experiences in the era of *Generally Available High Intelligence (GAHI)*.

## Topics
- The only human skill is human-connection.
- Health is about human connections at all dimensions 

## Human-In-The-Loop Services (HITPS)
- GAHI based services *GenAI* need the ability to engage humans in to the loop to make the intelligence impactful.
- Humans that are good at engaging with other humans to help them engage with intelligence.

## HITPS Example

- **"Child with speech difficulties."**
    - Parent consults *GenAI*
    -  *GenAI* creates a plan
    - Parent starts the plan with child
    - Child wont engage with the plan / process
    - Parent goes back to  *GenAI*
    -  *GenAI* searches for humans that can be be incorported in the health loop.

## Services In Practice

- We are building a community of health practitioners who recognise the transformative impact of generally available high intelligence (GAHI), helping bring order and deliver better health outcomes for humans.  
- We are currently building the team in preparation for running pilots:
  - How to organise now that we have GAHI as a society
  - Practice framework (Why, What, How, Who, When, Where)
    - Application for diagnosis
    - How to collaborate with GAHI, now that it is being used by society for diagnosis

## Tech
- **"*GenAI* searches for humans"**
    -  *GenAI* seeks serves using the Model-Context-Protocol (MCP) to find based on location and expertise.
    - *selfdriven.health* supports the MCP service using the [selfdrivenOS](https://github.com/selfdriven-engagement/selfdrivenOS).
