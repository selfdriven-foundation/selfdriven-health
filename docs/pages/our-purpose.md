## To accelerate a new healthcare system: preventive, coordinated, and intelligence-native — by uniting leading organisations around trusted identity infrastructure, AI, robotics, and verifiable governance.

To get and stay ahead of the healthcare curve by convening leading people and organisations to imagine and deliver the next phase of care — powered by identity, intelligence, robotics, and trust.

selfdriven.health exists to accelerate the shift from institution-centred healthcare to person-centred health systems. We convene the pioneers — clinicians, hospitals, insurers, researchers, regulators, builders — to design a new operating model where trusted identity (SSI + verifiable credentials) enables safe data portability, consent, and coordination across organisations. On top of this trust layer, intelligence becomes a real-time clinical copilot (triage, workflow, safety monitoring) and robotics becomes practical infrastructure (logistics, precision tasks, sterile repeatability). The result is not “more apps”, but a governed ecosystem: composable services, shared safety and audit evidence, and measurable improvement loops — enabling prevention-first care, lower friction, and better outcomes at scale.

### What

- Convene leaders across health, insurance, research, government, and technology to align around a next-generation care model.
- Build trust infrastructure using SSI + Verifiable Credentials for identity, consent, permissions, provenance, and auditability.
- Deploy intelligence + robotics to reduce friction, improve safety, and unlock prevention-first health systems at scale.

*selfdriven.health brings the right people together to build the future of healthcare as a governed ecosystem, not a patchwork of disconnected systems. We create the trust layer (identity, credentials, consent, audit evidence), then enable AI and robotics to operate safely inside those boundaries — improving coordination, reducing admin, increasing clinical safety, and shifting the system from reactive treatment toward prevention and continuous improvement.*


## Mission, Vision, Values

### Mission
To get ahead of the healthcare curve by convening leading people and organisations to imagine and deliver the next phase of care — powered by identity, intelligence, robotics, and trust.

### Vision
A world where healthcare becomes a continuously improving, intelligence-native public utility — preventive, coordinated, and trusted — so every person can access safe, personalised care without friction, waste, or institutional lock-in.

### Values / Operating principles

1. **Identity first (SSI-native)**
   - Care should be anchored in verifiable identity, credentials, and consent — not brittle accounts and siloed databases.

2. **Trust is engineered**
   - We treat governance, assurance, auditability, and safety cases as core infrastructure — not compliance afterthoughts.

3. **Prevention over repair**
   - We design for early detection and continuous improvement, not late-stage intervention.

4. **Human agency by default**
   - People own their data, permissions, and participation; clinicians keep judgement; systems reduce burden, not autonomy.

5. **Intelligence-native systems**
   - AI is embedded as a clinical coordination layer: triage, summarisation, decision support, and workflow — with clear boundaries.

6. **Robotics where repeatability matters**
   - Robots do the sterile, predictable, logistics-heavy work — improving safety and freeing clinicians for care.

7. **Interoperability as a moral stance**
   - Open standards, portable records, composable services — no walled gardens.

## Trust → Intelligence → Robotics → Coordination

## 1) Trust (Identity + governance)

**SSI + Verifiable Credentials become the health system’s shared truth layer**
- Patient identity + consent
- Clinician qualifications + scopes of practice
- Facility accreditation + compliance evidence
- Insurance coverage assertions + eligibility proofs
- Data provenance + integrity chains
- Audit-ready logs + verifiable events

## 2) Intelligence (Agentic systems)

**AI becomes the coordination layer (not the authority)**
- intake + triage + routing
- clinical summarisation
- risk signals + prevention nudges
- care plan assembly
- workflow automation
- anomaly detection + safety monitoring

**Boundaries are explicit:** *AI assists, clinicians decide, patients consent.*

## 3) Robotics (automation in the physical world)
**Robotics becomes “health ops infrastructure”**
- sterile repeatable tasks
- logistics + pharmacy movement
- sample handling + lab automation
- bedside assistance + monitoring
- facility throughput optimisation

## 4) Coordination (ecosystem outcomes)
**Care moves across institutions without friction**
- portable permissions
- composable service providers
- multi-party care teams
- continuous quality improvement loops
- shared evidence + measured outcomes
- lower cost / higher safety / better access
